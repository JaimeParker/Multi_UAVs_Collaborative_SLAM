% 目的、方法、结果和结论称为摘要的四要素。

% 研究背景 1,2句话
无人机应用的场景越发广泛，机上搭载设备的多样化意味着其能实现更多的功能。
% 问题，一句话
但是，在GPS拒止环境下，无人机完成对自身周围的环境感知较为困难；单架无人机执行任务的效率和成功率也不能保证。
% 文章主旨
为了解决这一问题，本文主要研究集群无人机协同SLAM。SLAM技术使得无人机在GPS拒止环境下也能完成对环境的感知和对任务的决策，集群无人机则使得任务的完成更加高效。
% 试验方法及主要结论
本文通过对ROS、PX4的研究和SLAM理论知识及开源方案的学习，进行了两架配备有单目相机的无人机在gazebo仿真环境下进行视觉感知，完成定位与建图任务；这样协作的方案使得每一架无人机拥有自己的地图，并通过特定的融合策略得到一致估计的地图；最后，在真机上进行了视觉SLAM的实验，为进一步多机自主定位与建图创造了条件。

Drones are being used in a wider and wider range of scenarios, and the diversity of equipment on board means they can achieve more functions.
However, in the GPS denial environment, it is difficult for UAVs to sense their own surroundings; the efficiency and success rate of a single UAV mission cannot be guaranteed.
In order to solve this problem, this paper focuses on cluster UAV collaborative SLAM, which enables UAVs to sense the environment and make decisions about the mission even in GPS-denied environment, and cluster UAVs make the mission accomplishment more efficient.
In this paper, through the study of ROS, PX4 and theoretical knowledge of SLAM and open-source schemes, two UAVs equipped with monocular cameras perform visual perception and complete localization and map building tasks in a gazebo simulation environment; such a collaborative scheme allows each UAV to have its own map and get a consistently estimated map through a specific fusion strategy; finally, a real aircraft on Finally, experiments of visual SLAM were conducted on real aircraft, creating conditions for further multi-aircraft autonomous localization and map building.
